# The binding of Isaac - Layout tracker

Welcome to the unofficial layout tracker for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.

This is a project made for a fan to help players track their location in maps with "Curse of The Lost".
Initially, I used it to track mine in the "Ultra Hard" challenge, but it can be used in every situation you can imagine.
